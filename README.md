Our app allows you to find ongoing sports games around campus. It also lets you know where games are at. It allows you to to make a game a game and join a game. Our map marker shows the location of the game. Upon clicking the game, it will display name of the game and location of the game. Upon loggin in, we will create a profile page for that specific user. This profile page can be accessed through the menu bar located on side of the map. Our repo has 6 branches and our master contains the merged and functional code of each of these branches. To run this code, you will need either an emulator or an android phone. Our team used Visual Studio Code and Android Studio Code to run/build the app. To run the app you simply type, "flutter run" and to restart the app you press "r". The Android app file (.apk) can be downloaded from the link on our website (https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/pickup/home), or directly from google drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-JkkXLGAbPAe2mswF32u6a6ixiAdVTDr ). Attempting to open the app on a phone running Android should prompt the user to install the app, after tapping through a number of security warnings.
