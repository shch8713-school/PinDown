Our app is an event service designed for CU Boulder community. We collect all of the public campus events and put it on our app, a singular platform and a shared calendar. The purpose is to help people spend less time on finding out events, and miss out less. Once people miss out less, a lot more events will have more people participating. There's no requirement to log in and sign up, just click one buttons and users can be able to see every listed public events. To run this code, you will need either an emulator or an android phone. Our team used Visual Studio Code and Android Studio Code to run/build the app. To run the app you simply type, "flutter run" and to restart the app you press "r". The Android app file (.apk) can be downloaded from the link on our website (https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/pickup/home), or directly from google drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-JkkXLGAbPAe2mswF32u6a6ixiAdVTDr ). Attempting to open the app on a phone running Android should prompt the user to install the app, after tapping through a number of security warnings.
