Our app allows you to find ongoing sports games around campus. It also lets you know where games are at. It allows you to to make a game a game and join a game. Our map marker shows the location of the game. Upon clicking the game, it will display name of the game and location of the game. Upon loggin in, we will create a profile page for that specific user. This profile page can be accessed through the menu bar located on side of the map.
