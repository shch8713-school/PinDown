WHAT IS A VECTOR FILE USED FOR? (SVG & PDF)

Vector files are very useful as they can be rescaled to any size without any quality loss. 
You may have seen JPG or Bitmap images that have blurry edges & messy quality... 
A vector file never has that problem. Vector files are mathematically calculated so that 
they adapt themselves perfectly to the new size. Vector files are commonly used for printing.
